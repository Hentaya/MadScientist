# Power 

### Power Switch

Grab the 9Volt battery connector and the tiny power switch.
Also grab a 5cm red female to female wire and the switch holder.

![Power components](/lessons/images/assembly/power_connector_switch.jpg)

Now take the chassis and feed the red wire from battery connector through the slot in the front of the chassis:

![Front Chassis Power Wire](/lessons/images/assembly/chassis_power_wire1.jpg)

Now grab the 5cm female to female red wire.

![Front Chassis Power Wire2](/lessons/images/assembly/chassis_power_wires2.jpg)

Get the power switch case and feed the two red wires through the rectangle slot at the edge of the power switch and connect them to the power switch.  The two wires need to be connected next to each other. Make sure one wire is connected to the middle pin and the other is beside it.  Which ever edge pin you connect the other red wire to, will determine where the switch need to be in order to be "on".   

![Switch wires Installed](/lessons/images/assembly/power_switch_close_up.jpg)

The switch simply connects the two pins closest to the switch. For, example, in the picture above, since the edge pin to the right is connected to the red wire, then the switch would be on as seen in the picture since the switch is pushed towards the edge pin with a connected wire. 
Notice which way  you install the switch so you know the off and on direction.  Off will be when the switch is in the direction of the empty pin not connected to a wire.
Now push the power switch into the rectangle slot pushing the red wires against the angled piece.  The red wires should make a sharp right angle inside the switch holder.  This helps hold the wires in place.

Now feed the short 5cm red wire's unconnected end into the chassis through the same slot the battery connector's red wire is coming out of.

### Battery Install  
Grab the battery door and battery door lock:
![Battery Door](/lessons/images/assembly/battery_cover_and_key.jpg)

Put the battery door under the bottom center of the chassis with the raised square section up and towards the front(away from the hitch). 
The tabs on the battery door opposite of the raised square go into the chassis first and act as a hinge point.  In the picture above, the tabs are on the right side.
Put the tabs up into the chassis and then pivot the raised square side up to be flush with the chassis.
While holding it there, take the battery door key and guide the long "sword" like end under the switch holder already on the chassis.
The long narrow "sword" part should slide just under power switch holder through the same slot in the chassis that power switch holder is in.
The pointing sword like piece should slide through into the raised rectangle piece to lock it into place.

Continue to slide the battery key through until it snugs the switch holder into place and the hex shape on the key fits into the similarly shaped hole on the switch holder.  

Battery door and key fully installed:

At this time, make sure the switch is turned off.  To turn off the power switch, push it in the direction of the single free pin not connected.
Now install the 9Volt battery.  Clip the 9Volt battery connector onto the battery and place it in the bottom middle of the chassis.  
Try to keep all wires ABOVE the battery.  If there are wires under the battery, you may not be able to connect them properly or change the battery easily later.

### Voltage Regulator

Grab the Power regulator: 

![Voltage Regulator](/lessons/images/assembly/regulator.webp)

The voltage regulator converts our 9volt power source down to a steady 5Volts which is what is required to operate the Pico.
The 3 pins from left to right our input, ground, and output as seen in the picture above.

Grab your chassis with installed battery, battery switch, and motors.  Also, grab the voltage regulator and the red y female to female cable.

![Chassis, Voltage Reg, Y wire](/lessons/images/assembly/power_regulator.jpg)

Now connect the single end of the red Y wire to the far right of the voltage regulator.  This is the voltage output pin.  Push the female end up as far as you can, usually up to where the pin enlarges.
Be careful not to bend or break the pins on the voltage regulator. If you do slightly bend the pins, it's not a big deal, just gently bend it back flat. Constantly bending the pins can weaken them.

Now connect one of the black ground wires from the battery connector to the middle pin. 

![Voltage Reg Ground](/lessons/images/assembly/power_regulator_negative_wire.jpg)

Now connect the 5cm red wire that comes from the power switch to the far left pin on the regulator.  

![Voltage Reg Input](/lessons/images/assembly/power_regulator_power_switch.jpg)

Now carefully move the voltage regulator on top of the battery without disconnecting any of the wires.  The hole on top of the voltage regulator should go on one of the posts beside the battery.
