### Power Switch

Grab the 9Volt battery connector and the tiny power switch.
Also grab a 5cm red female to female wire and the switch holder.

Now take the chassis and feed the red wire from battery connector through the slot in the front of the chassis:

Now grab the 5cm female to female red wire.

Get the power switch case and feed the two red wires through the rectangle slot at the edge of the power switch and connect them to the power switch.  The two wires need to be connected next to each other. Make sure one wire is connected to the middle pin and the other is beside it.  Which ever edge pin you connect the other red wire to, will determine where the switch need to be in order to be "on".

The switch simply connects the two pins closest to the switch. For, example, in the picture above, since the edge pin to the right is connected to the red wire, then the switch would be on as seen in the picture since the switch is pushed towards the edge pin with a connected wire. 

Now push the power switch into the rectangle slot pushing the red wires against the angled piece.  The red wires should make a sharp right angle inside the switch holder.  This helps hold the wires in place.

Now feed the short 5cm red wire's unconnected end into the chassis through the same slot the battery connector's red wire is coming out of.
