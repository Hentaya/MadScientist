### Power Switch

### Parts
- 9 volt battery connector
- 9 volt battery
- Power switch
- Power switch holder
- 5cm red female to female wire

Feed the red wire from the battery connector through the slot in the front of the chassis:

Grab the 5cm female to female red wire.

Get the power switch case and feed the two red wires through the rectangular slot at the edge of the power switch.  Connect one wire to the middle pin, and the other to either side.  The side that you connect the second wire to will determine where the switch needs to be in order to be "on".

The switch simply connects the two pins closest to it. For example, in the picture above, since the edge pin to the right is connected to the red wire, and the switch is pointed to the right, that means the switch is on.
Make a note of which direction is off.  Off will be when the switch is in the direction of the empty pin not connected to a wire.
Now push the power switch into the rectangular slot, pushing the red wires against the angled piece.  The red wires should make a sharp right angle inside the switch holder.  This helps hold the wires in place.

Feed the short 5cm red wire's unconnected end into the chassis through the same slot the battery connector's red wire is coming out of. Make sure that the switch holder is now flush with this slot. The easiest way to do this is to gently pull on the battery connector's red wire and the short 5cm red wire until you see the part of the switch holder they're coming out of fit through the slot.

### Battery Install  
### Parts
- Battery door
- Battery door lock

<img alt="Battery Door" src="/lessons/images/assembly/battery_cover_and_key.jpg" width="500"/>

Put the battery door under the bottom center of the chassis with the raised square section up and towards the front (away from the hitch). 
The tabs on the battery door opposite the raised square go into the chassis first and act as a hinge point.  In the picture above, the tabs are on the right side.
Put the tabs up into the chassis and then pivot the raised square side up to be flush with the chassis.
While holding it there, take the battery door key and guide the long "sword" like end under the switch holder already on the chassis.
The long narrow "sword" part should slide just under power switch holder through the same slot in the chassis that power switch holder is in.  This will lock it in place.

Continue to slide the battery key through until it holds the switch holder in place and the hex shape on the key fits into the similarly shaped hole on the switch holder.  

Battery door and key fully installed:

At this time, make sure the switch is turned off.  To turn off the power switch, push it in the direction of the single free pin not connected.
Now install the 9 volt battery.  Clip the 9 volt battery connector onto the battery and place it in the bottom middle of the chassis.  
Try to keep all wires ABOVE the battery.  If there are wires under the battery, you may not be able to connect them properly or change the battery easily later.

### Voltage Regulator
### Parts:
- Voltage regulator

Grab the voltage regulator:

<img alt="Voltage Regulator" src="/lessons/images/assembly/regulator.webp" width="500"/>

The voltage regulator converts our 9 volt power source down to a steady 5 volts, which is what is required to operate the Pico.
The 3 pins from left to right are our input, ground, and output as seen in the picture above.

Grab your chassis with installed battery, battery switch, and motors.  Also, grab the voltage regulator and the red Y female to female cable.

Connect the single end of the red Y wire to the far right of the voltage regulator.  This is the voltage output pin.  Push the female end up as far as you can, usually up to where the pin enlarges.
Be careful not to bend or break the pins on the voltage regulator.  If you do slightly bend the pins, it's not a big deal, just gently bend them back flat.  Constantly bending the pins can weaken them.

Connect one of the black ground wires from the battery connector to the middle pin.

Connect the 5cm red wire that comes from the power switch to the far left pin on the regulator.

Carefully move the voltage regulator on top of the battery without disconnecting any of the wires.  The hole on top of the voltage regulator should go on one of the posts beside the battery.
