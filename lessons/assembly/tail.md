# Tail Assembly with Photo Resistor

### Parts

Grab the tail, opaque tail tip, and photoresistor.

### Insert Photoresistor

Position the tail tip upside down, i.e. with the flat side facing up.
Take your photoresistor and carefully slide it into the slot in the tail tip.  Then take the photoresistor tip and put it **under** the uppermost bar.  Turn the photoresistor so the two metal pins are vertical and align the bottom pin with the slot in the tail tip.  See image below:

Now by pushing on the tip of the photoresistor, force it down into the tail tip while having the two wires got into the T-shaped slot.  To make it easier to align the pins with the slot, you may bend the wires a bit at an angle to make it easier for you.

Slide the photoresistor pins all the way down the T-shaped slot to the horizontal slot and rotate it 90 degrees so that the two pins straddle the vertical slot the pins just came through.  Flip the tail tip over, so the flat spot is on facing down.  You should see two small slots on each side of the vertical slot that your pins should rest in when they straddle the vertical slot.  NOTE: In the next few steps as you attach the tail tip to the tail, the photoresistor pins may shift in positions. This is ok, but the picture below shows the correct orientation the photoresistor should be in later when you attach it to the tail.  So, try to position it correctly now, but it will most likely jostle out of position as you continue and that's ok.  We will correct it later.

### Route the Wires

Now, route the end of photoresistor wires through the tail.  From the picture below, you can see the correct hole to put the wires through is the middle hole when the tail is upside down.  Try to keep the blue and black wires together on one side of the shaft inside the tail and the red wire on the other side of the shaft.  It doesn't matter which wires go on which side, the goal is not to twist the photoresistor pins and to keep them separated.  If the photoresistor pins are allowed to touch, it will not work properly.  It won't hurt anything, but just will not function as expected.

### Add the Tail Tip


Now carefully snap the tail tip onto the tail. To do this, hold the tail upside down and the tip up away from you so you can see the hole the wires .  Hold the tail tip up with the tip being up and the flat piece towards you as in the picture below.  Slide the tail tip down into the hole you previously routed the wires through.  At this point before you fully snap the tail tip in place, adjust the metal pins of the photoresistor into the two cutouts beside the vertical T-shaped slot.  When you snap the tail tip into place the photoresistor tip should be pushed slightly in and just beyond the crossbar in the tail.  This bar will also lock the photoresistor in place. Snap the tail tip in place now.

Once the tail is snapped in, pull the photoresistor back in a little til it is just behind the bar in the tail. We find this position gives the best detection of laser hits on the tail.

Once the tail tip is snapped in you are done with the tail assembly!  Rejoice!!!!
