Grab the chassis and the two motors and your two hex plugs.

Orient the chassis as seen in the picture above with the "hitch" to the right.
Now insert a motor into the top left and one in the bottom right.

Be sure to make sure the motors are flat on the bottom and the shaft extends out of the chassis as much as possible.

With the motors installed, take your hex plugs and slide them in from the middle of the chassis pushing the narrower end into the hex hole above the back of each motor.
