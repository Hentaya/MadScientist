# Chassis Assembly

### Parts

Grab the chassis and the two motors and your two hex plugs.

### Remove tabs

There may be two tabs attached to the inside bottom of your chassis that need removed.  Remove the two tabs if they are on your chassis.  They should easily bend and snap off with little effort.

### Add Motors

Orient the chassis as seen in the picture above with the "hitch" to the right.
Now insert a motor into the top left and one in the bottom right.  The motors have a flat top and bottom and rounded sides. Make sure the flat surface of the motor rest against the bottom of the chassis.  The correct orientation has the wires across from each other on a horizontal plane.

Be sure to make sure the motors are flat on the bottom and the shaft extends out of the chassis as much as possible.  There should be a small tab on the floor of the chassis that extends up slightly just behind the motor.  Make sure the motor is pushed in so that the tab is behind the motor.

If the motor is installed properly the shaft or axle should extend out almost as far and the wheel hubs on the chassis.

With the motors installed, take your hex plugs and slide them in from the middle of the chassis pushing the narrower end into the hex hole above the back of each motor.
Orient the hex plugs so they match the shape of the hole in the chassis and the tab on the end of the hex plug is horizontal.  Push the hex plug into place so that the fatter end of the hex plug is wedged into the chassis. Depending on how the parts printed you may or may not have a great fit.  If the hex plugs do not fit snugly, it's ok.  The hex plugs are supposed to just help keep the back of the motors from lifting up while you put on the wheels and tranny.  The hex plugs are optional and if they are not fitting well you can leave them out.
