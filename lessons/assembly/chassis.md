### Remove tabs

There may be two tabs attached to the inside bottom of your chassis.  If they are on your chassis, remove them.  They should easily bend and snap off with little effort.

### Add Motors

Orient the chassis with the "hitch" to the right (see picture below).
The motors have a flat top and bottom and rounded sides.  When inserting the motors, a flat side should rest against the bottom of the chassis so that the wires are horizontal.
Insert one motor into the top left and one into the bottom right.  Make sure the shaft extends out of the chassis as much as possible.  
There is a small tab on the floor of the chassis behind each motor.  Make sure the motor is pushed in so that the tab is behind the motor.

If the motor is installed properly the shaft or axle should extend out almost as far as the wheel hubs on the chassis.

With the motors installed, take your hex plugs and slide them into the hex hole above the back of each motor.  Be sure to orient the hex plugs so they match the shape of the hole in the chassis and the tab on the end of the hex plug is horizontal.  Push the hex plug into place so that the fatter end of the hex plug is wedged into the chassis. 
Depending on how the parts printed you may not have a great fit.  If the hex plugs do not fit snugly, it's ok.  The hex plugs just help keep the motors in position while you put on the wheels and tranny.  The hex plugs are optional and if they are not fitting well you can leave them out.
