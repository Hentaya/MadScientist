# Add Plate on Chassis

Now we are going to take the Pico plate with the Pico and motor controller and attach it to the chassis.  

Before we can put the plate down on the chassis, we need to connect the motors to the motor controllers pins that stick below the plate.  So, hold the plate close to the chassis with the bottom of the plate accessible.  The motor controller should be at the front of the chassis opposite of the power switch.  
See picture below for proper orientation.   
Connect the front motor to the `motor A` pins.  The motor A pins are the furthest from the front motor.  Connect the rear motor to the `motor B` pins.  Run the wires for the rear motor over the batter to connect to the motor controller.

Now run the y portion of the positive power cable from the voltage regulator up through the pico plate through the vertical slot to the right of the motor controller:
