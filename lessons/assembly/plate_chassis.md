# Add Plate on Chassis

Now we are going to take the Pico plate with the Pico and motor controller and attach it to the chassis.  

Before we can put the plate down on the chassis, we need to connect the motors to the motor controllers pins that stick below the plate.  So, hold the plate close to the chassis with the bottom of the plate accessible.  The motor controller should be at the front of the chassis opposite of the power switch.  
See picture below for proper orientation.   
Connect the front motor to the `motor A` pins.  The motor A pins are the furthest from the front motor.  Connect the rear motor to the `motor B` pins.  Run the wires for the rear motor over the batter to connect to the motor controller.

Now run the two ends of the red y power cable from the voltage regulator up through the pico plate through the vertical slot to the right of the motor controller:

Now run the ground(black) wire from the battery connector up through the same vertical slit in the plate:

Now carefully push the plate down onto the chassis.  Be careful not to disconnect wires from the motor wires from the motor controller or disconnect the power wires from the voltagle regulator.  Gently  push the plate down making sure no wires get pinched on the edges of the plate and the chassis.  The plate should fit down flush with the lowest top edge of the front and rear of the chassis.

Now it's time to connect the power cables coming from the voltage regulator and battery to the pico and motor controller.

Take the two red wires and connect one to the Pico's VSYS pin which is the second in from the top right of the pictures.  The other red wire goes to the (+) pin on the motor controller.  

The ground/black wire goes to a ground pin on the pico.  We recommend the ground pin right next to the VSYS.  That is 3 pins in from the top right in the picture.

Congratulations! You are super close to having a mobile rover!
