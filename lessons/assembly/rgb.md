# RGB Led Assembly

## Parts

Grab 4 male-to-female wires. Preferably red, green, blue, and black.  Also, grab the 2 RGB Leds (common cathode).

## Add Wires to Clip

Now take the male end of each wire and add them into the slotted portion of the clip as seen in the picture below. The tip of each male end should fit nicely in the slot at the top of the clip.  Make sure to have them in the same order as seen in the picture below.  Red, Black, Green, then Blue...

## Add RGBs

Orient your RGB as seen in the picture above.  Where the longest pin of the RGB is to the left side.  That is the longest pin should line up with the black wire and the pin to the left of the longest pin should line up with the red wire.  
When you have the LED in the right orientation, put its pins ontop of the male end of the wires in the slots. You may have to spread the pins apart from each other just a bit so they can fit the pins in the slots.
Try to get the LED pins as deep into the slots and as much of the pin into the slot as possible.  NOTE: In the picture below, the RGB Led to the right shows the correct orientation of the pins for both of the RGBs.

After getting the first RGB in place, go ahead and add the second on top of it.  Be sure it's orientation is correct as well.  That is the longest pin from the RGB Led goes on top of the black wire's tip.  Again, you may have to spread the pins of the RGB Led apart a bit to line up with the slots.  You will also have to bend the pins a bit for both of them so that the top of each RGB are not getting in the way. Easiest way to do this, is hold all for pins firmly and slightly pull the LED top towards you.

## Adding the Top Cover

Now with both RGB Leds into the slotted clip, it's time to add the top cover.  Align the top cover so that the 4 lines will go directly over the RGB pins in the slots.  These lines got into the slots as well to ensure the RGB Led pins are held in place and contacting the male ends of the wires. 
Carefully snap the top cover on top of the bottom.

Fully seat the top cover making sure it's bottom part snaps around the bottom of the first piece.

## Wiring to Pico

Now connect the female end of the wires to the Pico.
The RED wire goes to GP22, the BLACK wire goes to GND, the GREEN wire goes to GP21, and the Blue wire goes to GP20.  See the image below which is a zoomed in view of the [overall wiring diagram](/lessons/images/overall_layout.PNG).
