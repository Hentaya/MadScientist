### Wheels and Tranny

Grab your 4 wheels and two transmission pieces.

Now let's install the wheels.  

Take your 4 wheels and snap them on the chassis making sure the flat side is against the chassis.  Once they snap on, give them a spin with your hand to make sure they can spin freely without much resistance.

Now install the transmission pieces.  The key with installing the tranny parts are to line up the D shaped slot in the center of the tranny piece with the D shaped axle of the motor.  It's actually pretty easy to start inserting the tranny piece into the wheel until it hits the axle and then just rotate the wheel and the tranny till the D shaped hole and the axle line up and you can push the tranny in flush with the outside of the wheel.
