# Wheels and Tracks


### Wheels and Tranny

Grab your 4 wheels and two transmission pieces.

Now let's install the wheels.  

Take your 4 wheels and snap them on the chassis making sure the flat side is against the chassis.  Once they snap on, give them a spin with your hand to make sure they can spin freely without much resistance. 

**NOTE:** The pictures below show the Pico and other components already installed.  Your Rover may only have the motors installed at this point.  Some have found it easier to get the wheels and tranny on before putting the rest of the electronics in place.

Now install the transmission pieces.  The key with installing the tranny parts are to line up the D shaped slot in the center of the tranny piece with the D shaped axle of the motor.  If you have access to the motors, hold the motor down in place as you try to put the tranny in the wheel and line it up with the axle.  It's actually easiest to to start inserting the tranny piece into the wheel until it hits the axle(while holding the motor from sliding back) and then just rotate the wheel and the tranny till the D shaped hole and the axle line up and you can push the tranny in flush with the outside of the wheel.

### Tracks

Get your track pieces which should consist of two packs of 16 track pieces per container:

You should also find some pieces of 3D printer filament used to attach the track pieces. 

Take two pieces of track at a time and put them together as seen in the picture below and insert a piece of filament through the hole to connect the pieces.

Cut the excess filament off to be as flush as possible. If you have a little filament sticking out on each side, it should still be fine, but flush is better.

From this point just grab another track piece and add it to your existing connected track pieces and keep connecting until you get 16 of them connected in a line.

Now circle the track around and connect the two ends to make a fully connected track:

Repeat these instructions to assemble the second track.

Once both tracks are complete, simply put the tracks on the wheels. Just slip the track partially over one wheel and then stretch it back to wrap around the other wheel.  The track pieces are printed with TPU and should have a little flex, but you could deform the filament holding the track pieces together if you stretch it too much.
