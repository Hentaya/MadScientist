# Head Assembly with Eyes, LEDS, and sharp teeth! - oh my!

## Parts

- Noggin (head)
- Pearly White Teeth
- Laser with attached female dupont ends
- Front Cap Connector
- LED Harness Assembly
- Left Eye
- Not Left Eye (Right Eye)
- 2 RGB LEDs
- 4 Female/Female Dupont Jumper Connectors: selecting a combination of red, green, and blue (and any other color) wires will result in slightly easier wiring later.

## I've got my eyes on you

The below image shows which eye corresponds to which socket.

The eyes are marked with an "L" for Left and an "N" for Not Left (right).

### Eye Installation

This gif shows how to align the eyes for installation:

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/left_eye_install.gif" alt="animated image of left eye installation" width=300>

The following image shows the correct way to install the right eye. You might notice a small amount of extra material on the eye in the picture. This is from the 3D printing process and could prevent the eye from snapping into place. If you're having trouble getting the eye to fit (it's designed to be a tight fit), try carefully removing any excess material.

## Illumination!

The LEDs we are using (found in the parts list) are in this order: RED, GROUND, GREEN, BLUE.

The longer stem (second one down in the following picture) is the GROUND.

The following LED harness will allow you to wire two of these LEDs together.  It is crucial that your colors and grounds line up.  It is easiest to start with the ground wire and match

You may find it beneficial to use a pair of pliers to give all of your wires a slight curve so you can feed them through the harness appropriately.

Line both sets of wires together.

You can notice that we've used color coordination in our wiring.  You can also use the trick seen in the below photo to place your duponts in order so only the metal shows through the window of the harness on the ground wire.  

It's important to have at least one way to remember which order your LEDs are in.

You can see in the following photo how to pair up your wires before slipping them into the dupont jumper wires.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/LED_wire_lineup.jpg" alt="LED wire lineup" width=500>

Slip female ends of dupont jumpers over each of pairs of wires.

Carefully bend the dupont connectors with wires inside down towards the harness and then close snap shut the harness.

After you have snapped the harness closed you should adjust the LEDs to point in separate directions.  You will want them to be directed towards the eyes once the harness is mounted within the head.

Set your fully built LED harness aside for the time being, it's time to put in those shiny dentures.

## What a lovely smile you have!

Slide the teeth in from the front of the mouth opening towards the back.

There is a small ramp to help assist the teeth into place.  Slide the teeth up that ramp and use something small to set the teeth in place.

It may be helpful to lower the jaw slight (CAREFUL: don't snap it!) while you guide the teeth back into place.

Once over the ramp and settled in, you should be able to pinch the cheeks  to center the teeth appropriately.

## %$#@in LAZ3R BEAMS!!1

It is time to grab that laser!  

Guide the two wires (one at a time may be helpful) through the triangle guide in the bottom/rear of the teeth.  

There should be enough room while the teeth are mounted but if not, find another place to guide them up towards the center opening of the rear portion of the head.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/laser_wires.jpg" alt="wire placement for laser" width=500>

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/laser_wires_sitting.jpg" alt="wires placed for laser" width=500>

Place the laser in the slot/groove in the bottom section of the teeth.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/laser_setting_1.jpg" alt="laser setting in lower section" width=500>

Gently push the laser towards the front of the mouth where the opening is.  

The small groove of the laser lines up perfectly with the small cross-bridge piece of plastic and makes for a great alignment for the laser shooting out of the front of the shark.

## Harness the power of LEDs!

Grab your harness and place it in the back section of the head at a 90 degree angle with the "key" portion of the harness pointing towards the right eye.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/harness_install_1.jpg" alt="ninety degree harness install step one" width=500>

The key should slot down into the center piece of the back framing portion of the head.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/harness_install_2.jpg" alt="ninety degree harness install step two" width=500>

You can see in the image above how the tab barely sticks out of the center area.  Center the harness as best you can.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/LED_harness_centered.jpg" alt="LED harness centered" width=500>

Grab the front cap connector piece.

With your rover's head upside down, begin to slot the cap connector in place with the thicker tab on the side of the left eye.

There are a number of tabs that slot into each other with this step so be careful not to force anything if it doesn't glide smoothly.

<img src="/lessons/images/assembly/front_cap_connector_install.jpg" alt="front cap connector install" width=500>

Once you have fully slotted the front cap connector into place and appropriately centered the LED harness into place, you can do a final adjustment of the LEDs to point towards the eyes, and you will have your completed head unit!

Slot your head into place onto the front of the chassis!  Don't pinch any wires!

Refer to the following photo for how to wire your head's components to the board.

| LED wire color     | Pico pin |
|--------------------|----------|
| Red LED wire       | GP22     |
| Ground LED wire    | GND      |
| Green LED wire     | GP21     |   
| Blue **LED** wire      | GP20     |
| Blue **laser** wire | GP16     |

## CAP it all off!

Make sure that no wires are in the way of any pinch points and slot your middle cap piece into position.
It will secure nicely to the head and tail pieces as seen in the clip below.

### CONGRATULATIONS!  You have completed your shark ROVER assembly.

Happy Hunting.
