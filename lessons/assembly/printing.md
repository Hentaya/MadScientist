Orientation of print can match that of how the items are on the photo above.  The head should be printed with added organic supports to support the low points of the top gumline.  See image for example:

The head/"noggin" should be printed in 10% infil.

The rest of the parts relating the head can be printed at 100% infil.  No brim.  No supports.

The teeth can have the pre-added supports removed like in the image below.

The following image shows the correct way to install the right eye. You might notice a small amount of extra material on the eye in the picture. This is from the 3D printing process and could prevent the eye from snapping into place. Be sure to remove any excess materials from the eyes leftover from the printing process as it will make the installation process more difficult/impossible.
