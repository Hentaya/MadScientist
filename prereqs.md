## Prerequisites

You need a simple Python editor called Thonny which allows you write code on your laptop and execute it on the Pico via a USB cable. USB cables will be provided just make sure you have a laptop with Thonny installed and an available USB jack on your laptop.  
We will have a few USB C to USB A adapters for those with only tiny ports. We will not have Mac dongles so make sure you have a way to connect a USB A cable into your laptop. 

Please download and install the latest version(4.x or higher) of Thonny.  
[Download Thonny](https://thonny.org/) 

For these labs, you do NOT have to be a Python expert.  You can probably get by fine without having ever done Python programming before.  
However, some general programming knowledge is required. As long as you are comfortable with basic programming constructs(IF/ELSE statements, 
For/While loops, etc...) in other languagues we will have enough of the code for you to figure out the Python bits.
If you want to get a little familar with Python before coming you can check out this free tutorial get comfortable with Python. 
We will have code samples and links to reference materials if you just need to see how to do "normal" programming things in Python.
