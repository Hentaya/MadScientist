# Mad Scientist Labs

Fun learning with Electronics and Raspberry Pi Pico

This is kind of V2.0 of the Mad Scientist lab.  The original shark with laser game and more gentle introduction to electronics and the Pico can be found here: https://github.com/javaplus/PicoProjects


## The Grab

 Using Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers, Python, electric motors, 3D printed parts, and your ingenuity, you will construct a rover ready to conquer mars! This vehicle will be capable of traversing rough surfaces like those of the red planet and will be programmable to handle out of this world challenges. Remember those mechanical sharks with freakin' lasers on their heads? Well HONEY WE BLEW UP THE SHARKS and will be using those shark parts to transform these rovers into the ULTIMATE MAD SCIENTIST vehicles to fend off any threats you may encounter in this extra-planetary conquest.
Once you've built your functioning JAWS Rover in our lab, if you choose, you will have the opportunity to battle test your vehicle against other rovers to see who's design reigns supreme! Join us in this epic quest and learn to meld software and hardware together to accomplish our goal of bringing Sharks to Mars!

## Description

This is a tutorial for building a JAWS Rover.  A JAWS Rover is just like it sounds... a mix between a shark and a mars like rover.  

Nearly all the plastic parts are 3D printed and the brain is a Raspberry Pi Pico.  You will assemble the plastic bits and install the pico, the motors, wires, and other electronics to make a functioning autonomous rover.
We will use Python as the programming for the Pico microcontroller, but all code will be provided.

# Overview/Agenda
- Verify Parts from Parts Kit (link goes here to parts list and pictures)
- Assemble Tank Treads
- Snap Wheels on Body
- Add motors (Maybe connect wires to motors)
- Connect motor controller to Motors
- Connect Motor controller to pico
- Connect 5V regulator to Battery connector
- Connect connect battery power to Pico
- Connect laser to pico
- Connect Photo resistor to Pico
